# week3_project_cookie_clicker

This week's project was another challenge for me, although I did enjoy some elements of it. The demos that Sam did to set us off in the project really helped.

I think I have achieved all the basic requirements and only had time to implement some basic animation as part of the stretch goals.

One problem I did encounter was trying to make a separate function for the 'buy' button. Instead of all the alert logic sitting inside my addEventListener I wanted to move it to it's own function, which I would call inside the addEventListener. However, this started to cause bugs elsewhere in my code so I reverted it back.

I find the concept of passing arguments into other functions confusing, but hopefully the more I come across this the more familiar it will become. I also found it quite difficult to keep track of the code I've written as it's quite lengthy.

Sources I used to help me this week include MDN, GeeksforGeeks, W3School, StackOverflow and family members.
